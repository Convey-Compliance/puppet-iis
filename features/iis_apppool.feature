Feature: IIS App Pools
  In order to automate the configuration of IIS
  As an ops practitioner
  I want to use Puppet to manage IIS app pools

  Scenario: No changes when present
    Given an apppool called "PuppetTest"
    And its "autostart" property is set to "true"
    And its "processmodel_identitytype" property is set to "ApplicationPoolIdentity"
    Given the manifest
    """
      iis_apppool {'PuppetTest':
        ensure                    => present,
        autostart                 => true,
        processmodel_identitytype => 'ApplicationPoolIdentity',
      }
      """
    When puppet applies the manifest
    Then puppet has not made changes
    And puppet has not changed the "PuppetTest" apppool
    And puppet has left its "@autoStart" property set to "true"
    And puppet has left its "processModel/@identityType" property set to "ApplicationPoolIdentity"

  Scenario: No changes when absent
    Given no apppool called "PuppetTest"
    Given the manifest

        ensure => absent,
      }
