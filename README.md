puppet-iis
==========

Puppet module for configuring IIS.  The module is only about 35% complete.  See the Cucumber feature files in the features directory to see what the module can do so far.

Tested on:

- Ruby 1.9.2 p290 on Windows 7 64bit.

Puppet is not compatible with Ruby 1.9.3 at the moment.  It produces the error: "maxgroups=() function is unimplemented on this machine"
